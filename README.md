## Overview

This repository contains experimental data and visualization code supporting our research on improving locomotion capabilities of soft robots through passive compliant microspine arrays. Microspine grippers are bio-inspired mechanisms that engage with surface asperities to increase shear force and traction. While soft robots are ideal candidates for complex terrain due to their conformability, they historically struggle with grip stability and efficient locomotion outside controlled lab environments. Our work addresses the real-world deployment gap for soft robotics by enabling reliable traversal of unstructured terrain.

### Key Contributions

1. **Novel Design:** Two-row stacked microspine array utilizing independent compliant mechanisms for enhanced grip 
   stability
2. **Simplified Control:** Single actuator controls entire array through intelligent soft-compliant integration
3. **Field Validation:** Experimental testing on four real-world surfaces with varying surface topographies (concrete, 
   brick, sand, forest floor)
4. **Quantified Performance:** Demonstrated 18-25x improvement in displacement over baseline soft robots
5. **Patent Application:** USPTO Application No. 63/711,508

### Data Processing Scripts

#### `microspine_bar_chart.py`
Generates comparative bar charts showing average displacement across robot configurations (0ML, 1ML, 2ML) and surface types. Includes standard deviation error bars for statistical analysis.

**Usage:**
```python
python microspine_bar_chart.py
```

#### `microspines_ellipse.py`
Visualizes gait trajectories as ellipses, illustrating the cyclic nature of locomotion and comparing movement patterns across different microspine configurations.

**Usage:**
```python
python microspines_ellipse.py
```

## Experimental Setup

### Robot Configurations

- **0ML (Baseline):** Aqua soft robot without microspines
- **1ML:** Soft robot with 10 microspines in one array on a single limb
- **2ML:** Soft robot with 20 microspines in two arrays on two opposing limbs

### Test Surfaces

1. **Uniform Concrete:** Level surface with consistent asperity distribution
2. **Partially Uniform Brick:** Structured but irregular surface texture along brick perimeters
3. **Granular Compact Sand:** Loose top layer over compact base with scattered debris
4. **Forest Floor:** Highly unstructured terrain with large tree roots, leaves, and debris

### Tracking Methodology

- **Marker System:** 36h11 family AprilTags attached to each limb
- **Trials:** 3 trials per configuration per surface (36 total trials)
- **Gaits per Trial:** 60 push-pull gaits
- **Total Gaits Analyzed:** 2,160 gaits across all experiments

## Key Results

### Displacement Performance

| Surface | 0ML (Baseline) | 1ML                              | 2ML                          |
|---------|----------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Concrete | *1.32cm*       | **39.63cm** (>30x improvement)   | 14.13cm (>10x improvement)   |
| Brick | *0.59cm*       | **15cm** (>25x improvement)      | 10.52cm (>18x imrpovement)   |
| Sand | 0.82 cm        | **2.53 cm** (>3x improvement)    | *0.46 cm**                   |
| Forest Floor | *13.74cm*      | **23.95cm** (~1.75x improvement) | 21.32cm (~1.55x improvement) |

*Note: 2ML dug deeper into loose sand, resulting in slight burrowing and lower displacement on this specific surface.

### Critical Findings

- **Microspine arrays enable traversal of obstacles** (4" tree roots) that the baseline robot could not overcome on 
  the forest floor
- **Microspine array design provides redundancy** - not all microspines need to engage for effectiveness
- **Passive compliance allows stuck microspines to wiggle free** without hindering overall movement
- **Bottom row spines activate on uniform terrain**, top row engages on highly irregular surfaces
